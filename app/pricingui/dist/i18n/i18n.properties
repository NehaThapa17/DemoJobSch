TABLE_GROUP_HEADER=The tooltip that should be shown for this Element.In the most simple case, a tooltip is a string that will be rendered by the control and displayed by the browser when the mouse pointer hovers over the controls DOM. In this variant, tooltip behaves like a simple control property.
Controls need to explicitly support this kind of tooltip as they have to render it, but most controls do. Exceptions will be documented for the corresponding controls @e.g. sap.ui.core.HTML does not support tooltips
Alternatively, tooltip can act like a 0..1 aggregation and can be set to a tooltip control an instance of a subclass of sap.ui.core.TooltipBase In that case, the framework will take care of rendering the tooltip control in a popup-like manner. Such a tooltip control can display arbitrary content, not only a string.
UI5 currently does not provide a recommended implementation of TooltipBase as the use of content-rich tooltips is discouraged by the Fiori Design Guidelines. Existing subclasses of TooltipBase therefore have been deprecated. However, apps can still subclass from TooltipBase and create their own implementation when needed potentially taking the deprecated implementations as a starting point.
See the section Using Tooltips Information published on SAP site in the Fiori Design Guideline.
